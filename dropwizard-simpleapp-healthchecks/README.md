Simple dropwizard application only for showing how health check works 
=======================
Time metric of the RESTful API
-----------------------
@Timed has been added in front of the method BookResource#getBook(int id).
Jersey resources class annotated with this annotation will be instrumented by Metrics (please take a look at http://metrics.codahale.com/manual/jersey/) and following values will be measured or calculated:

> com.jingge.demo.msa.book.resources.BookResource.getBook: {

> count: 0,

> max: 0,

> mean: 0,

> min: 0,

> p50: 0,

> p75: 0,

> p95: 0,

> p98: 0,

> p99: 0,

> p999: 0,

> stddev: 0,

> m15_rate: 0,

> m1_rate: 0,

> m5_rate: 0,

> mean_rate: 0,

> duration_units: "seconds",

> rate_units: "calls/second"

> }

These values can be found when you point the web browser to http://localhost:8081/metrics.
To make sure some rational values will be shown, the BookResource#getBook(int id) has been slow down in purpose.

---------------------------
Create you own health check
---------------------------
It is also possible to implement you own health check by reating a new class that extends com.codahale.metrics.health.HealthCheck.
The class com.jingge.demo.msa.book.health.SimpleHealthCheck shows you an example, where the OperatingSystemMXBean (which itself is another interesting story, please see http://sellmic.com/blog/2011/07/21/hidden-java-7-features-cpu-load-monitoring/) from JDK 1.7 is used to figure out some OS information at the hardware level.
The minMemory is configured in the config.yml and injected into SimpleHealthCheck in App class.

Try yourself
-----------------

**Time metric**

1. Remove @Timed, run the application and take a look at http://localhost:8081/metrics
2. add @Timed, run the application and take a look at http://localhost:8081/metrics. A new metric under timers is shown for com.jingge.demo.msa.book.resources.BookResource.getBook.

**health check**

1. change the minMemory in config.yml to 3, run the application and take a look at http://localhost:8081/heanlthcheck.
2. change the minMemory in config.yml to 16 (assume you have a memory smaller than 16G), run the application and take a look at http://localhost:8081/heanlthcheck.
